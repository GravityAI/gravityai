    "This notebook demonstrates how to operate this library. Currently, only SHAP is fully supported. More features will be added later for SHAP, and ELI5 will also be supported.\n",

    "In the cell below, sample data and a model are loaded. Note that `classifiers` is a dictionary containing many models, and we are only interested in one of them for the purposes of this demonstration. When running this library yourself, you should be able to substitute your own custom trained classifier (anything compatible with the DeepSHAP library: https://shap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html). Generally, tree-based classifiers from scikit-learn or neural networks are compatible with DeepSHAP, but verify compatibility for your specific model through the link mentioned earlier."
